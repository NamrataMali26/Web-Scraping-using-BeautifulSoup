0,Neha,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy iphone or expensive product from Amazom,"  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible."
1,Krusshna,1.0 out of 5 stars,Donâ€™t buy it from this seller,"  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes arenâ€™t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options arenâ€™t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and donâ€™t regret after."
2,shanu Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Solid premium phone from Apple,  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
3,Sunny Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,First Time iPhone User Review :-),"  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it."

6,Gurmeet singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective Iphone 11,  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .
7,Vinay Kumar Gupta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too much heat on normal use,"  Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand.

8,ritesh,1.0 out of 5 stars,not a good product,"  helloPlease dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd.I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller."
